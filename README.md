# LeetCode Practice - Amazon

This repository contains my personal Python solutions to LeetCode problems commonly asked by Amazon.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Remain sharp on data structures and algorithms
- Practice writing clean, efficient code
- Apply Git version control

## Structure

Each problem is stored in its own file, named similarly to the corresponding LeetCode problem (e.g. `1_two_sum`), where `1` is the problem number and `two_sum` is the problem title.

Problems are organized by difficulty level into `Easy` and `Medium` folders.  
Each problem folder includes:

- `solution.py`: the complete solution with code comments
- `notes.md`: a breakdown of key concepts and data structures used

At the top of each solution file, you'll find the original LeetCode prompt and a list of the main topics involved. These topics are also explained in more detail in the accompanying `notes.md` file within the problem folder, with definitions and examples.
