## ENUMERATE()
- Lets you loop through string while tracking both char and index
- In this question: asks you to return the index of first unique char - enumerate gives you index automatically without needing a separate counter

## FOR LOOP
- Why useful in this question: strings are ordered, so you have to check chars in order to find first unique one
